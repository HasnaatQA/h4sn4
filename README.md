#Project discription

My project is a car inventory systsem. The application will let a user Enter differbet atrributes of a car, such as Make of the car, model and colour. The data is then stored on a file on the Vm and linked to the database Mysql. Mysql represents the iformation saved and inpuuted from the command line terminal on python. the application is a ideal crud application as it can create, read,update and delete data.

This print screen is a MVC diagram of my vehicle inventory system. There are two controller options which are Vehicle.py and the SQL database. The database stores information about the car in tables such as the make of the car, model of the car and lots more.

The flowchart shows the structure of the application and what factors need to be put in place for the application to be run succesfully. As shown from the diagram, the application has stages in which the user has to input in order for the application. An example of this is if the user cannot enter the colour of the car until the make of the car has been added. It is very significant that each of the devlopment is followed as shown.
