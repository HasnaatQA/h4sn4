#Project Aim
To create a Crud application and the application should display tables in the database MYSQL

#Technologies Needed and will be Used
- Python
- SQL Database
- Flask
- Gannt chart ot Kanbanboard for planning


#Project discription
My project is a car inventory systsem. The application will let a user Enter differbet atrributes of a car, such as Make of the car, model and colour. The data is then stored on a file on the Vm and linked to the database Mysql. Mysql represents the iformation saved and inpuuted from the command line terminal on python. the application is a ideal crud application as it can create, read,update and delete data.

#Architecture

This print screen is a MVC diagram of my vehicle inventory system. There are two controller options which are Vehicle.py and the SQL database. The database stores information about the car in tables such as the make of the car, model of the car and lots more.

#Flowchart

The flowchart shows the structure of the application and what factors need to be put in place for the application to be run succesfully. As shown from the diagram, the application has stages in which the user has to input in order for the application. An example of this is if the user cannot enter the colour of the car until the make of the car has been added. It is very significant that each of the devlopment is followed as shown.

The method and application which I used to set targets and track my progress was with the use of Trello boards, this helpmed me signficmatly as it allowed me to ogranise different tasks accordingly.

#Build

The printscreen shows the build of application. An example of the code shows the class is inventory and the while statement is being used. This suggests that the application should print whatever values are shown in the brackets, in this scenario it is adding a vehicle, deleting vehicle from storage and more.

#Testing
Testing is a huge part of devoplment, It allows to see if there are any bugs in the application or if the product works as it is expected.

An example of this test case is made to see whether the test will be passed if a user inputs a number meaning Integer. We wanted to see if the application throws an exception or not. Because in the test an Int Number has been isnerted which means the test has failed as that is what the application expects to happen.

In this scenario, we can see that that has passed this is because string has been inserted instead of the data type Integer. The application has passed as it is expected to throw an exception if an Interger is not added.

#Conclusion/Sumarry

Overall I think the application is great and is a ideal application for storing system or can be even used for a checklist. However the application still can be improved. One way this could have been done is by adding more features. An additional feature which I could have implemented if I had more time was to view vehicles that hold or share the same values. Example of this can be selecting an option colour and all the cehicles with red stored would only be printed. This would be a good comparison technique.
